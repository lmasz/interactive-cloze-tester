Organizations understand the value mobile devices can add to their employees productivity by providing access to business resources at any time. Not only has this reshaped how traditional in-office tasks are accomplished, but organizations are devising entirely new ways to work. Yet mobile devices may be lost or stolen. A compromised mobile device may allow remote access to sensitive on-premises organizational data, or any other data that the user has entrusted to the device. The NCCoE mobile device security efforts are dedicated to solving businesses most pressing mobile cybersecurity challenges.
